## Crosswalks and Mappings
Since realizing the need for standards to more effectively share collections-levels metadata, several groups have invested time and effort to develop crosswalks between existing standards, and existing software schemas (like at [GRBio](http://scicoll.org/grbio_error.html) now to be at GBIF). We provide links to these resources here and ask that you add more if you have them.  

Initially, we are using a Google Spreadsheet as the collaboration platform for crosswalks.  We will try to keep a snapshot of those documents deposited here, but the snapshots are not the master documents.

#### Field Museum (FM) Insights
Open this [google doc: Field Museum Take on NCD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1upx7URInghFCBhx5LnHJMAhOLA2Q6xuJAYIJI2uLXBA/edit?usp=sharing) to look at the FM's evaluation of NCD and current insights about the needs for a standard to share collections-level metadata. Also note their related presentation at TDWG 2017: [What's Missing from All the Portals](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/20236/) on the same topic.
