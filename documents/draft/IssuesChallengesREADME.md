# Considerations for Development of a CD Standard

## Known Issues for the Task Group
* Resource discovery -- taxonomic and geographic coverage; collecting/collector history (expeditions?); ancillary collections and data sets, such as tissues, field notes, measurements, inventories.
* Provide guidelines for referencing collections and specimens in both human readable and machine actionable forms
* Integrate registration of data providers with collection-level descriptions, including material that is not yet digital
* Estimating the scope of digitization work to be done; conversely, summarize what has been digitized
* Data quality assessment

## Known Challenges
* tracking undigitized collections (need to discover them first)
* allow / deal with merging / splitting collections
* it is suggested that "we" authoritatively manage the IDs necessary to implement this. Will need to use contextual clues embedded in records to disambiguate.
* exactly which parts of these records need to be (must be) machine readable?
example: collectionCodes confusion, who are the contacts for what purpose
* prototype. Will there be a public interface for humans to update? Some (most?) of this will be via an API - not human-mediated. So how do these fit / link so everyone can fulfill their role.
* access / curatorial control: Authorization (Authentication), Curation, Accreditation
* authority. Who are the authors of this data?
* life-cycle issues. what can we learn about life-cycle issues from the publishers?
* branding is an issue making sure collections (and individuals?) can be tracked - credited - attributed.
* collection outreach / invitation. We will need carrots / incentives to invite / include people in this endeavor. We need a model (is there one)?
* can we use this as a way to bootstrap curation of collections data? (future)
